    <div class="title">The Garífuna Voices of Guatemala's Armed Conflict: Memories of the civil war in Livingston's Afro-indigenous community excavate an untold history long excluded from the official record.
    </div>

    <div class="author">Authors: Artiaga, Scherly Virgill
    </div>

<div class "pull-quote"> "During that period, you lived in fear, constant fear!" Sergio told me."
</div>

<p>Decades later, Rosa* still remembers the feeling of terror. During Guatemala's armed conflict, the police used to knock on doors in her Caribbean coastal town to tell people to turn out the lights, though no one could sleep anyway, she recalled. "When the war reached Livingston, we were scared," the 78-year-old, dressed in a white gown with an orange scarf over her hair, told me in her living room, surrounded by carefully placed family photographs. "Oh God! We were indeed very terrified."</p>
PHOTO (COLOR)
<p>Rosa referred to the 1960-1996 civil war as "their war," a reference to Guatemala's Ladino (mestizo) and Maya populations. As a Garífuna woman, she believed she was not a part of the war, and yet the violent episode had terrorized her community greatly. She still remembers tragedies, like the killings of four young Garifuna men in Livingston in the late 1970s at the hands of the military.</p>
<p>Her story, which she shared with me in January 2017 as part of my three-year research project collecting Garífunas' war-time oral histories, rescues the Garífuna voices omitted from the national narratives of the armed conflict. The Garífuna are an Afro-Indigenous community that dispersed along the Central American coast more than two centuries ago after the British expelled them from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent.</p>
PHOTO (COLOR)
<p>In the quarter century since Guatemala's 1996 Peace Accords ended 36 years of brutal armed conflict, Garífunas' unique accounts of the war as it happened in Livingston have not been formally shared, collected, nor archived. Stories engrained in their memories have never been told because the government, scholars, nonprofits, and other agencies entrusted with gathering the testimonies of thousands of survivors and victims of state terrorism accepted the idea that the war only affected Ladino and Maya populations. During the war, more than 200,000 people were killed and thousands more were disappeared, mostly at the hands of the Guatemalan state.</p>
<p>The majority of the victims were Maya. Contrary to the official narrative, however, the war also devastated other ethnic groups, including the Garífuna. They may have not been massacred, but during the armed conflict many Garífunas died, were forcefully recruited and served in the military, lost their land and resources, and were tortured. Others fled to other countries, welcomed displaced Maya communities, and participated in the peace process.</p>


<p>Sergio, a Garífuna from Livingston who was forcibly recruited as a teenager by the military in the late 1960s, resents that the years of violence in his hometown remain in obscurity. </p>
<p>"The history of the armed conflict our country experienced does not mention the Garífuna at all. It is not documented, but our people also paid a high price, with their lives," said Sergio, who had been swimming with friends when soldiers scooped him up and took him away without his parent's knowledge. "How much suffering and death does the Garífuna community have to endure in order to be counted?"</p>
<p>The definitive record of human rights violations committed during the armed conflict, compiled by the United Nations-backed Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH) based on thousands of testimonies of war survivors, details the state terror perpetrated against Maya communities and political dissidents, trade unionists, religious leaders, and other activists. The Commission identified the Maya population "as the collective enemy of the state" and documented massacres and scorched earth campaigns that razed entire Maya villages.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the CEH's final report, "Guatemala Memory of Silence," issued in 1999, omitted Garífuna testimony. The report states that the Commission used newspaper and radio ads, including announcements broadcast in nine Mayan languages, to call on Guatemalans to share information about incidents or grievances that occurred during the armed conflict. No announcements were made in the Garífuna language or for the Garífuna people.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the CEH's work, the report states, was to "satisfy the right of the Guatemalan people to fully know the truth" and to avoid a repeat of the painful history of armed conflict. It also recognized that "a firm and lasting peace cannot be built on the foundations of silence" but requires "knowledge and truth." </p>
  <p>The report zoomed in on the grave abuses against the Maya, the "most affected" population, "without denying that the rights of all the Indigenous peoples of Guatemala were violated."</p>
  <p> And yet, the report effectively erased the Garífuna experience from the national narrative of the armed conflict, implying that their suffering and afflictions were not worth documenting. Other efforts to collect testimonies, such as the Guatemalan Catholic Church's 1995 Recovery of Historical Memory project and 1998 final report, followed in the same footsteps, entirely disregarding the Garífuna voice in its examination of the war as lived and narrated by the victims.</p>

<div class="subhead">Living in Constant Fear</div>
<p>During the armed conflict, state terrorism in Livingston followed a similar playbook of violence and coercion applied to other conflict zones throughout Guatemala, especially during the regimes of military dictators General Romeo Lucas García (1978-1982) and convicted war criminal General Efraín Rios Montt (1982-1983).</p>


<p> "During that period, you lived in fear, constant fear!" Sergio told me. Sergio's forced service in the Armed Forces exposed him to vile acts of violence inflicted in the coastal region of Izabal. </p>
<p>"The military was in charge of pulling these people out at night and killing them all. These poor people had to dig their own pits [graves]!" he recalled. "I was so conflicted with all this violence because my cosmovision is different. It is not to exterminate people." Sergio was discharged from the military in 1976 after being jailed for defying extrajudicial orders.</p>

<p>From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the Guatemalan military fed its ranks through forced recruitment. In Livingston, military recruitment not only destabilized the community, it also provoked a massive exodus of young Garífuna men to other regions of Central America and to the United States, mostly to New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle. At the time, an estimated 8,000 Garífunas lived in the area of Livingston and nearby towns. According to Guatemala's 2018 census, today there are approximately 1,675 Garífunas living in Livingston.</p>
<p>Edgar, now a student at Guatemala's Rafael Landívar University, was six years old when heavily armed men prowled outside his church and forcefully seized young men. Edgar was too young to be recruited, but he remembers young Garífunas fleeing in terror and soldiers exacting violent captures.</p>
<p> "I saw when they took a Garífuna and tied him up like an iguana. They wrapped his arms and hands," he said. "In fact, they tied him up by the neck after beating him up."</p>
<p>To dodge the army recruiters, mothers dressed their sons in women's cloths and boarded them on boats in the middle of the night, recalled Gloria, an activist and organizer in Livingston's Garífuna community.</p>
<p> "These young Garífunas knew the route very well and knew how to go around the military base located in Punta de Cocolí, which was a strategic place for military operations. But with the help of the dark night, our ancestors, and God, these young men were able to cross the ocean and go to Belize," she said.</p>
<p>"It was a critical situation because we were a community without any constitutional rights and without the recognition from our own government," Gloria added.</p>
<p>In 1986, her nephew, Nelson, was arrested and tortured in broad daylight.</p>
<p> "They got him!" neighbors told her family, who already knew the unfortunate meaning of those words.</p>
<p>When the family arrived at the police station, Nelson was in handcuffs, hanging from the ceiling, Nelson's sister, Martina, told me with tears in her eyes as I interviewed her in Seattle, Washington in March 2017. Knowing his family was watching, the military continued torturing Nelson.</p>
<p>"They didn't tell us he was still alive. In fact, they told us he was dead," recalled Martina, who left Livingston in 1999 as a result of the war.</p>
<p> Martina's uncle, at that time the deputy mayor of Livingston, effectively intervened for Nelson's release. Nelson's mother then treated his heavy internal bleeding and the marks all over his body using natural remedies. </p>
<p>"My nephew couldn't walk for a long time," Gloria recalled. "After his health improved, he moved to Belize and from there, he migrated to the United States. No one ever took responsibility for this crime."</p>

<p>For Dalia, an active member of the Asociación de Mujeres Garífunas Guatemaltecas (Guatemalan Garífuna Women's Association), the armed conflict devastated the community on a moral level. She remembers the deaths of eight Garífunas during the war. </p>
<p>"We are a small community, so when one person dies, it's like one million people died," she told me. "Our community felt their deaths very deeply."</p>
<p>Afraid that their community could become a target of increased state terrorism, Garífunas bore these injustices and mourned their dead in silence. The CEH, in its report, concluded that the ethnicities of 3 percent of fatalities during the armed conflict were unidentified. </p>
<p>Since there are no records that indicate that Garífunas were included in any official report, it is not clear whether Garífunas fall into the CEH's count of "other/unidentified" fatalities.</p>
  <div class="subhead">Coexisting with the "Bearded Men"
  </div>

<p>Along with these stories of state violence, survivors of the war in Livingston also have memories of the "barbudos en botas" (bearded men in boots)—the guerrilla. According my interviewees, guerrilleros often marched the streets of Livingston at night in search of provisions.</p>
<p>"People used to say: Here come the bearded men!" Carlos, a member of the Livingston Garífuna community who often interacted with the guerrilla, told me. "Our people ran away and went into hiding when they came."</p>
<p>For Dalia, the guerrilla's presence in Livingston did not inflict physical violence but caused a socioeconomic massacre.</p>
<p>"They came here crossing the mountain from the region of La Ciénaga, because their camp was between Petén and Livingston, near Chocón Machacas," she explained. "As Livingston became a 'passing place' for the guerrilla to get provisions, Garífuna farmers abandoned their land, afraid that insurgents would attack them or their families."</p>
<p> Historically facing limited access to food and resources from other regions in Guatemala, the Garífuna in Livingston had for decades depended on their fertile lands for food production.</p>
<p> "The guerrilla took the Garífuna crops at night," Dalia said. "We never said anything because we lived in fear."</p>
<p>Despite the fear that the guerrilla initially instilled in the community, eventually, many guerrilleros became part of the town. People I spoke to marveled at how the guerrilleros managed to live among the people of Livingston without being detected or captured by the military.</p>

<div class "pull-quote">"I always thanked God and asked him, 'Please Lord don't let me kill an innocent man. It doesn't matter if he's against the government, don't let me use this gun.'"
</div>

<p> The Ranchón—a popular nightclub at the time located one block away from the police station—"served as a meeting point where guerrilleros ate, rested, and replenished themselves with goods," according to Gloria. "How these guerrilleros were not detected by the military is something we just don't understand," she added.</p>
<p> "They could have attacked or bombed each other, but they didn't. This is a small town—surely the military knew they were here."</p>

<p>Dinora, a street vendor, remembers how guerrilla meetings being held in Livingston became almost ordinary.</p>
<p>"There was a man named Moncada. Everybody knew that name here," she said. "When he was here in town, he never hid himself. Everybody saw him. In all honesty, he never gave me any reason to not trust him ... He was very respectful. He was a loyal customer."</p>
<p>The alliances built between the Garífuna and the guerrilla seem to have saved this community from greater exposure to state violence. According to the stories I collected, the guerrilla never forcibly recruited or attacked Garífunas.</p>
<p> "The guerrilla came but never massacred our people because we never went against them. We used to talk to them about freedom and democracy," said Sergio, who returned to Livingston after being discharged from the army.</p>
<p> "If the military found out we communicated with them, they would have probably massacred us." Sergio, who eventually became a lawyer, participated in the peace process in the early 1990s by brokering talks between the guerrilla cell Frente Polochic and the government—another Garífuna experience omitted from the history of the armed conflict. </p>
<p>"I had to go to the mountain to negotiate with the guerrilla their transition to civil life," he told me. "I was there for 15 days."</p>

<div class="subhead">Serving in the Army While Black
</div>
<p>Also inexistent in the published history of the armed conflict are the names and stories of many Garífuna soldiers who served during the civil war. One former Guatemalan sergeant, Edgar's uncle, Franco, greeted me with his left hand when we met. A white towel hung over his opposite shoulder. He later told me that on June 30, 1967, when he was 20 years old, a grenade exploded in his right hand. He was following the orders of a military commander, who was drunk at the time, to move the explosives without following military protocol. Doctors later amputated Franco's arm. </p>
<p>"I experienced many things," Franco told me. "I always thanked God and asked him, 'Please Lord don't let me kill an innocent man. It doesn't matter if he's against the government, don't let me use this gun.'"</p>
<p>Leonel, a Garífuna who left Livingston in the mid-1970s, remembers how the military mistreated the Garífunas they recruited, mocking their bodies, language, and cosmovision during training. </p>
<p>The most Garífunas could aspire to in the military, he claimed, was to become sergeants, never commanders, because "people didn't like Black men in positions of authority."</p>
<p> He added: "I know Garífunas who were killed before becoming commanders." </p>
<p>According to Garífuna blogger César, who fled to Belize in 1980 at the age of 19 after being detained by the military for his political views, the majority of Garífunas in the army were cooks.
  <p>"They were the ones feeding the soldiers," he told me.</p>

<div class="subhead">Still Seeking Justice
</div>
<p>What my conversations with Garífunas made clear is their love for La Buga, their word for Livingston. "La Buga is a place of peace," all the Garífunas I interviewed told me. For thousands of Maya refugees displaced from their villages from the 1970s to the late 1990s, La Buga was, indeed, a safe haven—a place of peace. According to my interviewees, Garífunas stood in solidarity with Maya people who took refuge in Livingston. </p>
<p>"They were welcomed here," Gloria said. Livingston, however, has since seen a drastic drop in its Garífuna population due to the war, economic instability, and the unfulfilled promises of the Peace Accords.</p>
<p>One of those promises was enshrined in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous People, signed in Mexico City as part of the peace process on March 31, 1995. The agreement defined Guatemala as a "multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual" state. </p>
<p>Although this brought visibility and recognition to the Garífuna and other communities, Indigenous groups have argued that Guatemala has not enacted the implications of such a foundational statement in its constitution. </p>
<p>"We hoped that the Peace Accords would bring equality and equity among the groups, but it hasn't happened yet," Dalia told me. "The Garífuna community continues to suffer from social injustice, underdevelopment, and racism." Post-conflict processes also failed to give Garífunas access to "the full truth about the human rights violations and acts of violence that occurred in the context of the internal armed conflict," which, according to the Peace Accords, is a necessary part of "national reconciliation and democratization." </p>
<p>For centuries, Garífunas have leaned on their oral traditions to preserve and pass on the history of their ancestors to the next generations. The armed conflict will not be the exception. </p>
<p>Yet Garífunas, too, need to find closure and deserve a space in the collection of testimonies and memories of the armed conflict. These stories will eventually die along with the generation of Garífunas who can still tell us about their experiences of war—unless we make an effort to unsilence them.</p>
